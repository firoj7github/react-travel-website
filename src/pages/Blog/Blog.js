            <h4>1. Difference Between Authorization and Authentication???</h4>
            <h6>Ans :Authorization in system security is the process of giving the user permission to access a specific resource or function. This term is often used interchangeably with access control or client privilege.Authentication is the act of validating that users are whom they claim to be. This is the first step in any security process.Despite the similar-sounding terms, authentication and authorization are separate steps in the login process. Understanding the difference between the two is key to successfully implementing an IAM solution. </h6>

            <h4>2. Why using firebase ? What other optoin do you have to implement Authentication?</h4>

            <h6>ans : Firebase is a toolkit and infrastructure that aims at supporting the process of building better applications and growing a successful business. This technique continues to innovate and dominate the BaaS (Backend as a Service) market. Along with the time, it has grown so much that it has become a key component of Googleâ€™s mobile strategy. It was bought by Google and now it is being constantly improved in order to make the user experience much more convenient and productive.The Firebase database offers so many services due to which it has great potential, so that it may easily replace custom backend development depending on the product development stage and the final goal (whether the product is built to engage active users or you need an MVP or a prototype). If you need to achieve a proof of concept with minimal resources, then Firebase is a good choice because it's free for a number of users and is preferable for the beginning. You may control the system and make changes while adapting the market, and later it may be easily converted into a customized backend. Its features include Authentication, Cloud Firestore, Firebase Analytics, App Indexing, Hosting, Cloud Messaging, and many more modules.</h6>

            <h4>3.What other service does firebase provide other than  Authentication??? </h4>
